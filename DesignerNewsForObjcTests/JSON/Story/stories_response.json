Actually the web-page is not fully finished, but I am happy that someone has revealed the project and has been inspired enough to share it :-)\r\n\r\nSome comments on the feedback.\r\n\r\n1. First of all (this is actually the most typical feedback I am getting so far) considering the absence of scrolling controls. There are two concerns about scrolling: controlling the scrolling position, and indicating of that an area is scrollable. The scrollbar provides the solution for both of them, and therefore this is something what is naturally expected from a scrollbar replacement. But Intence is only about indication and does not provide any controls, and this was done intentionally. The last two paragraphs on the web-page explain it, but I will repeat myself here. The idea is that controlling the scroll position is performed by other means. On my personal opinion, in most cases there is no need provide any additional controls, since scrolling with a mouse wheel / touch screen should be enough (we will see soon if I was wrong). But of course there might be some special cases when additional controls may be suitable, or when more exact information about scroling position is demanded. The solution is suppposed to be searched by a particular application developer. Currently they avoid searching for alternatives, since ordinary scrollbar does the job somehow (like a shit on my opinion). Intence is designed to take no space and be transparent to mouse events.\r\n\r\n2. The indicator must not be bright and annoying. See the example with code, and with the map. Scrollable area is indicated not by a highly contrast image, but by a content fading out. On the web-page I used highly contrast images to take attention of a reader.\r\n\r\n3. Considering the issue of when you start scrolling the page, and then your pointer gets into an inner scrollable area and starts scrolling it instead. This is not actually related to Intence, but of course should be avoided by an application developer. On the web-page of Intence I could not find a simple solution, because I needed to show many scrollable areas. In other applications the solution could be to simply avoid nested scrollable areas (like either a big scrollable page with static content, or an application split into several scrollable frames / areas).",

Some people bitch about the lack of a Pinterest style layout for the subscription feature, which I also felt at first, but the way they have it set up makes you review everything that comes in with a discerning eye. It's not that big of a deal in terms of efficiency/time suck.\r\n\r\nIt's also great because you can save video's and gifs to the library, and the browser view is great as well. However, I use Screenflow when recording some cool interaction on a site, etc. I tried to use the built in screen recording feature in Ember and it was shit.\r\n\r\nThe other lousy thing about ember is that their browser extension doesn't work/hasn't work for a very long time. Maybe they're never going to fix this, so you end up having to open the site you're looking at on chrome inside of the ember browser if you want to take a clip of the whole/part of the screen. That's also not that big of a deal, but I do remember when it worked and it was slightly faster. I try not to use screenshots on my mac because when you throw those references into Ember there is no data associated (site of origin, etc.) Whereas taking a shot in ember automatically grabs everything. \r\n\r\n### For articles, design resources, etc.\r\nI use Evernote. I feel like this is the best tool for that. Fast and easy to manage with hot keys in the browser extension.
